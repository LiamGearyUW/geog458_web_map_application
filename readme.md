## Map 1

The first map shows Covid rates by county in the form of a choropleth map on Mapbox's light basemap. Rates are measured by cases per 1,000. Colors range from pale yellow (low rate) to reddish-orange (high rate). Interactive elements include the ability for the user to hover over a county and see its name and Covid rate in the upper-left box. Legend is intuitive and contains sources.
